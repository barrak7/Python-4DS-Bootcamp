# Python-4DS-Bootcamp
is a Python For Data Science Bootcamp organized by [1337AI club](https://ma.linkedin.com/company/1337ai) at [UM6P](https://um6p.ma/). <br>
It is a contribution to the UM6P community and an effort by the club to establish a thriving AI community at our beloved university.

The Bootcamp is based on the peer to peer and learning by doing pedagogies. The idea was inspired from our school's, [1337FIL](https://1337.ma/en/) & [42 Network](https://www.42network.org/), pedagogy.

This learning methodolgy is pretty simple (yet very effective): You are given projects or exercises. You can use the internet to figure out how to get them done.

If something is difficult for you, you can ask your peers for help. You also discuss your findings and results once you are done.
